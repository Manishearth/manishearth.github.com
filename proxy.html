     This script lets one quickly control most of the proxy settings on Ubuntu, including the APT (Ubuntu Software Center) settings and browser settings without having to know anything about Ubuntu. It also helps one install chrome/chromium and simplecpp. In addition to initial setup, it also lets one reconfigure the settings with new userids or by turning them off altogether.<br><br>
Note that I have not <em>thoroughly</em> tested this yet, but everything it does is reversible. Drop me a mail at <a href="mailto:manishg@iitb.ac.in">manishg@iitb.ac.in</a> if you have any issues/suggestions.
<br><br>
Instructions:

<ol>
<li>Download script from <a href="https://raw.github.com/Manishearth/Manish-Codes/master/Bash/proxy.sh">here</a>. If the script doesn't directly download, hit Ctrl-S, navigate to your Downloads directory, and save it there. For convenience, let it stay in your Downloads directory</li>
<li>Open Terminal (Ctrl-Alt-T)</li>
<li>Navigate to the script directory. If you have saved it in your Downloads folder, simply type <code>cd ~/Downloads</code> and hit Enter.</li>
<li>Type <code>bash proxy.sh</code> and hit Enter. The script should start. It will ask you for your Ubuntu password as well as your LDAP login info.</li>
<li>After this, one should get a menu. For most purposes, choosing option 1 should be enough, it walks through the entire setup, asking you for confirmation whenever there is an optional step.</li>
<li>The rest will be explained by the script :)</li>
